# Circulating cell clusters aggravate the hemorheological abnormalities in COVID-19

Here are input files for the simulation of three types of clusters in blood flow under a shear rate of 10 1/s: WBC-WBC (white-blood-cell with white-blood-cell), PLT-PLT (platelet with platelet), and WBC-PLT (white-blood-cell with platelet)

These codes were used in to investigate the dynamics of different types of circulating cell clusters and study how COVID-19 affects the rheology of blood.
